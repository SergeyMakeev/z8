# Z8 : fantasy 8-bit system

## What is Z8
Z8 is a fantasy 8-bit system similar to the following fantasy computers:

**Pico-8**

**nano JAMMER**
https://morgan3d.github.io/nano/doc/specification.md.html

**SHENZHEN I/O**

The main difference from systems above is that Z8 was designed to teach my kids how to program and not as a puzzle/game.

Z8 was made using the following principles:
- As few abstractions as possible (kids should know how the real hardware works)
- To be as simple as possible (everything should fit into one screen. Including IDE, Debugger, Screen, Memory dump, etc.) 
- To be as much close to real hardware as possible. Most of the principles and knowledge you will get while working with Z8 must be applied in real life. Of course, I cut some corners to simplify the learning process, but the main principles the same as for real hardware.
